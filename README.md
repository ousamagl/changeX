# changeX
At changeX, we are creating a whole network of people, aiming to exchange numerous types of products such as books, video games, multimedia, sport equipments and collectables. 
The main principle of the application is simple, every logged in user can access the list of the exchange offers put by other users. Nevertheless, the user cannot move to the exchange process only if he has already announced an exchange item with the same category in progress.
Thus, there are two states describing a logged in user:
* The user doesn’t have an exchange item in progress:

In that case, he can only preview the list of the exchangeable items set by other users without proceeding to the exchange process.
How can he proceed to the exchange?
EASY! The user has the choice, either to start by inserting an exchangeable item by accessing to the “What i have” part, or to start by  seeking his needs by accessing the “What i need” part, both of the  parts exist in the “add” section. If he  starts  by  the “What i  have” part  for example, the user needs to fill a form containing the information needed.  If the book already exists in the application’s database, an additional option will automatically fill the form to accelerate the process to the user. After that, by accessing  the “What i need” part, the user has the choice to select an existing item from the database, or to fill a form that contains the information about the  exchangeable item he needs. And it’s finally done! 
The user now has an exchangeable item, and an exchange offer, added to the preview list.

* The user already has an exchange item in progress:
In that case, while previewing the list of the  exchangeable items, three types of buttons may appear in front of every item, 
depending on what the logged in user filled in the “what i have” and the “what i need” form. The three types are the following: “I have the item you need”, “you have the item i need” and “perfect match” which means that the logged in user has what the other user needs and vice-versa ( the application will automatically disable the bottons for unnecessary operations)
Too lazy to browse in order to find  the item of your dreams? Our application tells you not to worry about that, thanks to our notifications feature, the application notifies the user if there’s an added exchangeable item that fits his needs.
Cool thing, right?
Once clicking on the exchange ad, details of the exchangeable item are shown as well as the user’s details, and a button is available to proceed to the exchange. By clicking on it, the other user, on the other side, receives a notification, informing him that a user wants  to exchange his item. By accepting the exchange, the user is forwarded to a form, in order to fill details of the exchange, having  the choice to organize a meeting or to send the item by post office. Once filled, a notification is sent to the other user, containing the exchange process details, he has the choice whether to accept, to modify the meeting details, or to decline the offer.  If he accepts, an email is sent to both users, containing details of the exchange process.  And after the end of the exchange period, both users are required to evaluate each other, they are free whether to attribute a like or a dislike to each other. That’s it!
What about the user profile?
The user profile contains the number of likes and dislikes attributed to him in his former exchange processes, this option helps other users to know if the user concerned  is trustworthy or not.  In addition to that, the user has the ability to update his profile information, and his profile picture and to check the history of his exchange processes to keep track of all his data.
Our team is determined to update more exchange categories and to add more features, in addition to that, soon we’ll adopt artificial intelligent features in order to upgrade the UX part in our application, stay tuned for more great stuff!
